      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        The Late Night Library CIC is a safe, inclusive space for people from the LGBTQ+ and neurodivergent communities, as well as those at risk of isolation and unemployment. We provide workshops in creative arts, endangered crafts, and creative writing in Dover and the surrounding areas.

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Our goal is to raise funds to occupy a space where we can create a safe environment for people from our community and other vulnerable adults to socialise, without alcohol. Here, you can access events such as open mic poetry, no pressure book club (read at your own pace!), drag quiz nights, and many more!
      </p>
      <p>
        We support local artists and small businesses, and offer an open access studio with a range of equipment and resources to help people start their creative journey.
